# CopulaLab

CopulaLab is a minimal Python package designed to study and apply copula models for dependence modeling and quantitative research.

The package focuses on building a transparent and modular framework to work with different copula families, including:

- **Elliptical Copulas** (Gaussian, Student-t)
- **Archimedean Copulas** (Clayton, Frank, Gumbel, Joe, N13, N14)
- **Mixed Copulas** (Vine copulas)

This package is intended for personal research, academic exploration, and educational purposes, with a focus on clarity, flexibility, and full control over implementation details.

## Features

- Fit and estimate copula parameters via maximum likelihood estimation
- Generate random samples from various copula families
- Fully modular structure for future extensions
